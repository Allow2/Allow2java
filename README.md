# Allow2java

todo: Port https://github.com/Allow2/Allow2node to a Java library
(Note: there is a prototype full offline C library we should consider after the base port. Just keep a note here to do so).

Oh, and we should build this library to be easy to install via a package manager if applicable/appropriate. (Maven?)
